    "According to global card industry research company Nilson Report, $33 billion was lost to credit card fraud in 2022. Reducing that fraud will lead to savings for  companies, which will sell fewer goods and services to fraudulent buyers and thus incur fewer costs associated with such sales (such as chargebacks). For example, the dataset used in this project was provided by Vesta Corporation, which guarantees that credit card transactions will go through in exchange for a cut of the revenues. Whenever a transaction does turn out to be fraudulent, Vesta is responsible for compensating the seller for the lost volume. Reducing credit card fraud by detecting it when it happens will reduce costs for transaction guarantee companies such as Vesta.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, reducing the number of fraudulent transactions will help consumers by protecting them from accidentally paying for fraudulent transactions and by also lowering how much they pay for goods and services (since providers will not need to raise prices as much to account for fraud costs).
