    "Data consists of two types of datasets, with both test and training verions of each, resulting in total: 4 data sets: train_identity, test_identity, train_transaction, and test_transaction. They key feature we are looking to analyze is the 'isFraud' field, indicating whether a transaction has been flagged as fraudulent or not. The first step was to combine the test and train datasets into their own, resulting in a train and test dataset. \n",

    "The Train and Test datasets consists of multiple groupings of features: TransactionID: ID of the transaction, TransactionDT: timestamp of transaction, TransactionAMT: transaction amount, ProductCD: product code, card1-6: card type and other information, addr1-2: billing address of transaction, dist1-2: distance from billing adress to address of purchase, P_emaildomain: purchaser email domain, R_emaildomain: reciever email domain, C1-14: feature that is counted across different transactions (meaning not given in dataset), D1-15: times between transactions (meaning not given in dataset), M1-9: Matches of fields for each transaction (meaning not given in dataset), V1-???: (meaning not derived yet), id_01-id_38: identification information accumulated by anti-fraud software that developed dataset, DeviceType: type of device transaction was done on, and DeviceInfo: information of device. isFraud is a field only present in the train dataset flagging whether a transaction is considered to be fraud or not (0-not fraud, 1-fraud). \n",
