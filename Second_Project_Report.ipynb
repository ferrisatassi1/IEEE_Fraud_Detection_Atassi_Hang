    "Machine learning and artificial intelligence methods have been used to detect credit card fraud for at least 30 years. Bolton and Hand’s 2001 paper “Unsupervised Profiling Methods for Fraud Detection” outlines how supervised methods were used in the 1990s to detect fraudulent transactions. Reflecting the overall popularity of neural networks in that decade, neural networks were used in supervised learning models for fraudulent transaction detection. Building upon that work, Bolton and Hand outlined how unsupervised methods such as clustering and nearest neighbor methods could be used to build unsupervised learning models to detect fraudulent transactions. Their proposed models, “Peer Group Analysis” and “Break Point Analysis,” grouped accounts into peer groups and analyzed changes in their behavior over time, looking for moments (“break points”) in which individual accounts’ behavior suddenly diverged from that of their peers, which could be indicative of fraud.\n"

    "Data consists of two types of datasets, with both test and training verions of each, resulting in total: 4 data sets: train_identity, test_identity, train_transaction, and test_transaction. They key feature we are looking to analyze is the 'isFraud' field, indicating whether a transaction has been flagged as fraudulent or not. The first step was to combine the test and train datasets into their own, resulting in a train and test dataset. \n",

    "The Train and Test datasets consists of multiple groupings of features: TransactionID: ID of the transaction, TransactionDT: timestamp of transaction, TransactionAMT: transaction amount, ProductCD: product code, card1-6: card type and other information, addr1-2: billing address of transaction, dist1-2: distance from billing adress to address of purchase, P_emaildomain: purchaser email domain, R_emaildomain: reciever email domain, C1-14: feature that is counted across different transactions (meaning not given in dataset), D1-15: times between transactions (meaning not given in dataset), M1-9: Matches of fields for each transaction (meaning not given in dataset), V1-???: (meaning not derived yet), id_01-id_38: identification information accumulated by anti-fraud software that developed dataset, DeviceType: type of device transaction was done on, and DeviceInfo: information of device. isFraud is a field only present in the train dataset flagging whether a transaction is considered to be fraud or not (0-not fraud, 1-fraud). \n",
